Variant of xarg. It varies in some respects, such as ease of random call order

map mplayer ~/music = find ~/music | xargs mplayer
map mplayer ~/music r = find ~/music | shuf | xargs mplayer

If one desires the command not simply have the file appended to the end of it, explicitly append @: map "app @ arg@". Use of @ may be escaped

Map can easily aggregate files
map mplayer /music /music/submusic /m/file.mp3 /m/m c
Would go through all the directories and file.mp3 choosing randomly due to c

There is also an i and an s, loop and sort resp

Note that all previously mentioned options are sugar for the :iterator syntax

map. contains a list of macros. asdf,fdsa will replace asdf with fdsa

The use of , as an appendage operator can be useful in conjunction with M:
map mplayer , music Notwist c #with music,/hassle/is/long/path/ as map.
Will randomly play from /hassle/is/long/path/Notwist

One may wish for bias in their random, for this we have numbers to lie the deed:
map mplayer c 4 , music Notwist music
Interpreted as:
map mplayer c , music Notwist , music Notwist , music Notwist , music Notwist music

Replacement before concatenation before multiplication

, , x y z -> xyz
, 2 , x y z -> xyxy z
